## Installation
The project works on two anaconda environments for segmentation code and classification code respectively.
Use this command for installing the anaconda environment for the segmentation code
```shell
cd BRAF_Classification/aidan_segmentation/nnUNet_pLGG/environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
After installing the environment for segmentation, insall the environment for 
the classification code using this command. 
```shell
conda env create -f 2d_approach.yml
```

## Usage 
The pipeline processes a single T2W nifti iamge at once. To run the pipeline on an image, put the raw unprocessed nifti image in the src_ip_dir folder. 
```shell 
cd BRAF_Classification/aidan_segmentation/nnUNet_pLGG/src_ip_dir
```
once the image is loaded in the directory the pipeline can be ran by the following command 
```shell
./pipeline.sh
```
Classification output will be printed on the terminal screen along with the running logs.
